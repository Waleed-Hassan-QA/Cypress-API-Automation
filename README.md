This project automates **CRUD operations of REST APIs** using **Cypress** along with **Assertions**.  
It includes both **positive and negative test cases** for the following API operations:

- **GET**  
- **POST**  
- **PUT**  
- **DELETE**



## üîπ Test Coverage

### 1) GET API
- Get all user records  
- Get single user  
- Invalid endpoint validation  
- Invalid user ID validation  

### 2) POST API
- Create new user  
- Create new user & verify from GET API  
- Create duplicate users  
- Validation checks with wrong inputs  
- Invalid endpoint validation  

### 3) PUT API
- Update user data  
- Invalid user ID validation  
- Validation checks with wrong inputs  
- Invalid endpoint validation  
- Invalid token validation  

### 4) DELETE API
- Create & delete user  
- Invalid user ID validation  



## üîπ Test Data
- Test data is stored in **fixtures** and reused across **POST** and **PUT** API calls.



## üîπ Reporting
- Integrated with **Mocha Awesome Reports**.  
- A detailed HTML report is generated automatically after test execution.  



## üîπ CI/CD Integration
- This project is integrated with **GitHub Actions**.  
- Tests run automatically on every code push.
